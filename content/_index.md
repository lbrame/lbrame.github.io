## `whoami`

Hi, I'm Luca! It seems like you have landed on my website, so here's a quick introduction.

I graduated with a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** from [Universit√† di Verona](https://www.univr.it/home) in March 2025 and I currently work as a backend Software Engineer, while I work through my **Master's Degree** in Computer Science and Engineering.

I love **Linux** and FOSS. I also happen to write about them, both here on this blog and on [LibreNews](https://thelibre.news)!
